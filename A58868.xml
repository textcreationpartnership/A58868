            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO Dr. <hi>SHERLOCK</hi>'s Preſervative againſt POPERY. SHEWING, That <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> cannot be Defended, nor <hi>Catholic Faith</hi> Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but by <hi>Principles,</hi> which make void all <hi>Reaſon, Faith, Fathers, Councils, Scripture, Moral Honeſty.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TRUTH being all of a piece, hath this advantage, that it can never be oppoſed by <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reaſon:</hi> whatever charge is drawn up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, muſt prove either falſe in the Premiſes, or erroneous in the Conſequence. The firſt Oppoſers of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Truth in <hi>England</hi> being ſenſible of this, fell preſently to <hi>Forgeries,</hi> clipping of <hi>Texts, Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> and by <hi>Miſrepreſentations</hi> to caſt ſo much dirt upon the face of Truth, as disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo her native Beauty, that the common Herd not diſcovering ſo ſoon the Cheat, were frighted into the oppoſite Errors, glaz'd over with a falſe varniſh. This method they ſtill follow'd on, as long as the liberty of Preſs and Pulpit was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd to thoſe who could eaſily have wip'd off that dirt, and laid open ſuch groſs Cheats. The <hi>Advice to Roman Catholics,</hi> tho' reprinted ſince, yet firſt ſet forth by Dr. <hi>Cumber</hi> in the time of the pretended Plot, when whatever was boldly ſworn or ſaid againſt <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> tho' falſe to the degree of impoſſibility, was greedily ſwallow'd, is a fair inſtance in this caſe, whence <hi>ſuch</hi> falſe Citations, tho' they bore in the front of a <hi>Preface</hi> all aſſurance of Truth, can be produced by dozens. Now that Innocency and Truth have room to gather breath, and ſpeak for themſelves, the method is ſomewhat alter'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thoſe who write againſt <hi>Catholic Verities,</hi> tho' they cannot wholly forget the old trick of Miſrepreſenting, ever continu'd, from <hi>Tyndall</hi> and <hi>Jewell</hi> to Dr. <hi>Teniſon;</hi> yet generally they make uſe of the ſecond ſhift of <hi>erroneous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences</hi> and falſe Inferences, not ſo readily ſeen through by leſs cautions and prepoſſeſt Readers: From particular Propoſitions true in themſelves, they infer ſuch general Aſſertions, or joyn Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſo looſe, wild and erroneous to a plain Text of Scripture, that any Error may ſhelter it ſelf in the Cloſe, tho' the meaneſt Logician can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but bluſh at ſo open a Fraud. I happened to be lately preſent at a full <hi>mix'd</hi> Aſſembly in the City, where this method, well follow'd by the <hi>Anſwerer unto the Addreſs to the Miniſters of the Church of England</hi> being fairly laid open, moſt of the Proteſtants there aſham'd of it, found no better <hi>ſalvo</hi> than to diſown the Anſwerer as an ignorant Scribler who had betray'd his Cauſe. The Name of him that licens'd the Paper ſhould, I conceive, have covered it from ſuch reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. I know not the Anſwerer, and will not charge him with any other fault, than of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving undertaken the defence of a bad Cauſe,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44980:3"/> which may as well be the effect of Engagement and Prejudice, as of Ignorance. To juſtifie him ſo far, I will give an inſtance taken from the <hi>Preſervative againſt Popery,</hi> that the Cauſe bears no better defence, tho' it might otherwiſe have been expected from ſo fam'd an Author as Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> who yet could not ſupport it but by ſuch Principles as make void all uſe of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Faith, Fathers, Councils, Scripture,</hi> and <hi>moral Honeſty,</hi> as I ſhall make appear in few lines, enlarging my ſelf ſomewhat more on <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> the Gift I perceive which he moſt values himſelf upon, eſpecia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <head>Principles of Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all right uſe of common ſenſe.</head>
               <p>He charges Catholics with this great Crime, (<hi>fol.</hi> 3.) That <hi>they will not allow the reading he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Books,</hi> and proves his Charge becauſe <hi>God not only allows, but requires it.</hi> Since one Error may infer another, that Congregation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed which allows to each man, and even <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> him, to ſtand to his own Choice and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muſt allow that liberty; and how his Fellow-Miniſters can juſtifie themſelves, who uſe all endeavors to hinder their Flock from hearing Catholic Sermons, and reading Catholic Books, I know not; much leſs how the Congregation eſtabliſhed here lately by Law, having declared that each man was bound (as Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> often repeats it in his <hi>Preſervative) to judge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> yet could force all Diſſenters not to ſtand to that their Judgment, but to comply againſt it, and that by Excommunications, Sequeſtrations, Impriſonments, Excluſion from all the Preferments and Advantages of a free-born Subject, even by Hanging and Quartering: this, I confeſs, comes not within the reach of common ſenſe &amp; reaſon. But for us Catholics, who have inherited from St. <hi>Paul (Gal.</hi> 1. 8.) that Faith, that if an <hi>Angel from Heaven</hi> ſhould teach us any thing in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to it, we ought not to mind him, or return him any other Anſwer than <hi>Anathema.</hi> How God ſhould require from <hi>Us</hi> to read heretical Books, I confeſs my reaſon cannot teach me. He blames then this Inference, You have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Guide, therefore you are no more to ſeek.</p>
               <p>Fol. 4. <hi>Ask them, Whether they will allow you to judge for your ſelves in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? If they do not, why will they trouble you with diſputing? you cannot be convinc'd unleſs you judge too, and thereby reſolve Faith into a private Spirit.—Here let our Proteſtant fix his foot, and not ſtir an inch till they diſown Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility.</hi> This is to ſay, 'tis impoſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vince a man that in reaſon he ought to ſubmit his Judgment to that of any other, tho' infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Doth not this pretty Logic make void all the right uſe of common ſenſe and reaſon, when it ſhould lead us to ſubmit to any juſt Authority? We find St. <hi>Paul Act.</hi> 19.) frequently diſputing in the Synagogue; he pretended to Infallibility through the Spirit of God who directed him: But Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> takes the <hi>Jews</hi> part againſt him, bids them <hi>not ſtir an inch,</hi> not hearken to him, till he diſowns Infallibility. Spoken like a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctor.</p>
               <p>Fol. 6. <hi>What difference is there betwixt mens uſing their private Judgments to turn Papiſts or to turn Proteſtants?</hi> The ſame, as betwixt two ſick men, the One whereof chooſes to put himſelf in an able Doctor's hands, whom he knows to have an Infallible Remedy, whil'ſt the other chooſes his own Simples, and makes his own Medicin; as between two at Law, the One whereof is guided by his reaſon to take Advice from a Wiſe Counſellor, the Other to be his own Counſel; as between two Subjects, the One whereof is guided by his reaſon to take up Arms for his King, the Other to judge of his King's Right and Command.</p>
               <p>Fol. 9. Now the Doctor takes the Catholic's part, and tho' ſaintly, yet ſpeaks well in ſo clear a Cauſe: <hi>The intention of theſe Diſputes is only to lead you to the Infallible Church, and ſet you upon a Rock, and then 'tis very natural to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce your own Judgment when you have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Guide.</hi> But now for convincing Reaſons againſt this plain Truth. The firſt is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They cannot with any ſenſe diſpute with us about the particular Articles of Faith, becauſe the ſenſe given of Scripture and Fathers takes its Authority from the Church underſtanding it ſo.</hi> This is falſe. The ſenſe takes its Authority from God who ſpoke that Word, tho' we are certain that we have the true Senſe of that Word becauſe we receive it from the Church, which is protected and guided, in delivering us both the Letter and Senſe, by the Infallible Spirit of God, that is to abide with her <hi>for ever,</hi> according to Chriſt's promiſe, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14. 16. If <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> diſpute which is the right way to a place, is <hi>John</hi> diſabled from convincing <hi>William</hi> of his miſtake by Reaſons, becauſe he hath with him a Guide who certainly knows the way, and that he would himſelf paſs by thoſe Reaſons, if his Guide aſſur'd him that he apply'd them ill and wrongly to that way?</p>
               <p>Fol. 11. <hi>Muſt the belief of an Infallible Judge be reſolved into every man's private judgment? Muſt it not be believed with a Divine Faith, and can there be a Divine Faith without an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judge?</hi> There can be no <hi>Divine</hi> Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Divine Revelation, nor a <hi>Prudent</hi> One
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44980:3"/> without a moral Evidence in the motives of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility, on which may be grounded the evident Obligation to accept of it. The Judgment being poſſeſt with that moral Infallibility, reſts not there, but obſerving that Goodneſs and Mercy of God, which cannot permit that Falſhood ſhould be propounded in his Name, with all the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Marks of his Hand and Seal, and without any like appearance on the contrary; inclin'd by a pious motion of the will, called by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Council of <hi>Orange affectio credibilitatis,</hi> and ſtrengthened by that Grace of God which beſtows the Gift of Faith, faſtens on God's Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, and with a ſubmiſſion not capable of any doubt, embraces the revealed Truth. If the Infallibility of the Church were more than morally evident, it were impoſſible that any Hereſie ſhould be.</p>
               <p>Fol. 17. <hi>No underſtanding Proteſtant can be diſputed into Popery, which owns an Infallible Church:</hi> Firſt, <hi>becauſe no Arguments or Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations can give me an Infallible certainty of the Infallibility of the Church.</hi> We ſaw Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> juſt now pleading for the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt St. <hi>Paul;</hi> now he reaſons even againſt Chriſt our God bleſſed for evermore. His words prove that Chriſt, who own'd himſelf Infallible, did imprudently to Preach, or work Miracles; for ſince they could not give an <hi>Infallible Certainty,</hi> (an <hi>evident</hi> one he means by his whole Diſcourſe) no prudent <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile</hi> could be diſputed by him into Faith. Arguments ſo offenſive to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ears ought to meet with no other Anſwer than Prayers for him who offers them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis impoſſible by reaſon to prove that men muſt not make uſe of their own Reaſon and Judgment in matters of Religion.</hi> That men muſt uſe Reaſon to come to the Knowledge, <hi>that</hi> God hath revealed what they believe, is very certain, as the <hi>Jews (Exod. 14.) Crediderunt Domino, &amp;</hi> Moyſi <hi>ſervo ejus; did believe God, and</hi> Moyſes <hi>his Servant;</hi> all Nations, <hi>Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;</hi> ſo each Chriſtian now, <hi>Chriſt and his Church;</hi> the firſt as Author, the ſecond as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes (commiſſioned from God) of their Faith; by conceiving the Proofs they offered of their Commiſſion. So far Judgment: So the Apoſtles believed Chriſt ſaying of himſelf that he was the Son of God; their Judgment being convinced that God ſpoke by him; which method appears moſt particularly in the man born blind, whom he cur'd, and who was thereby convinced, that <hi>God was with him, Niſi Deus eſſet cum illo:</hi> but after that, there is no further uſe of Reaſon, if we believe St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but in order to the <hi>bringing into Captivity all Underſtanding into the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.</p>
               <p>The Doctor frames a Diſpute (<hi>fol.</hi> 21.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a <hi>ſturdy Proteſtant</hi> as he calls him, and a <hi>Catholic.</hi> You may gueſs how well he manages the Catholic's part. In the Coucluſion he gives this topping reaſon for the Proteſtant Religion: <hi>We have as much aſſurance of every Article of our Faith, as you have of the Infallibility of your Church.</hi> This is the great point indeed, which if a Proteſtant loſes, he loſes all; for 'tis certain and evident, that the Catholic has the ſame aſſurance for each Article of his Faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Church, which he hath of the Churches Infallibility. He proves it, firſt, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are in general aſſured that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the word of God.</hi> Hitherto there holds ſome parity, tho' but lame; but ſuppoſe it were entire? The Concluſion would be this: <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics are as certain of the Senſe of Scripture, as Proteſtants are that they have the Letter;</hi> whence it follows demonſtratively, that when Proteſtants differ in the Senſe from Catholics, they have leſs aſſurance for it than Catholics, who have always as much as the Proteſtants have for the Letter, whereas Proteſtants muſt never be more certain of the Senſe of the Letter, than of the Letter it ſelf.</p>
               <p>2dly, <hi>And in particular we are aſſured, that the Faith which we profeſs is agreeable to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> If he means they have the ſame proofs for this, which Catholics have for the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Church, that is, for the being of that Church which declares her ſelf Infallible, (for a Church erring in ſuch a point would ceaſe to be the Church of Chriſt) then 'tis evidently falſe, ſince each Chriſtian in this Age hath the ſame Evidence of her being the Church of Chriſt, and of her teaching Truth, and conſequently of her Infallibility, which he hath of Chriſt, <hi>viz. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, Miracles, &amp;c.</hi> which no Proteſtant as much as challenges for the Certainty of the particular Senſe of Scripture. What other Senſe this Propoſition can have, I do not conceive.</p>
               <p>Fol. 23. <hi>If you muſt not uſe Reaſon and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Judgment, then you muſt not by any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be perſuaded to condemn the uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> I never read ſo much and ſo little of <hi>Reaſon;</hi> there is ſuch a rumbling of the word, which for eight or nine lines occurs at leaſt once in each, and yet ſo little ſenſe. All he ſays might be with equal weight ſaid by a ſick man, who diſſuaded from chooſing his own Remedies, and deſir'd to ſend for a skilful Doctor, ſhould anſwer, <hi>'Tis impoſſible by reaſon to perſuade me not to uſe my reaſon in governing my ſelf by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as my own reaſon teaches me, which would be to condemn reaſon, and yet be guided by your reaſon.</hi> Such Diſcourſe would prove the ſick party at leaſt ſomewhat light-headed; what 'tis a Symptom of in Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> I will not be poſitive in.</p>

               <p>Fol. 25. <hi>We muſt allow of no reaſon againſt the Authority of plain and expreſs Scripture; we may reaſonably conclude that God underſtands the Reaſons and Nature of things better than We.</hi> This is a very true and Catholic Principle, whence I may infer, That our Doctor, when he comes to apply it, will ſure enough be guilty of ſome moſt illogical Inference. And behold I am in the right! <hi>But, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve, is ſuch a plain and expreſs Scripture.</hi> Well, go on, therefore without any expoſition, <hi>no Reaſon can juſtifie the Worſhip of another Being.</hi> A rare Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to infer a Negative from an Affirmative Antecedent! 'Tis like this: A Subject muſt love his King, and owe Allegiance to him alone; therefore no reaſon can juſtifie the love of a Child for his Father, or of a Wife for her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. St. <hi>Auguſtin (Q. 61. in Gen.</hi>) drew the contradictory Concluſion from that Text; he takes off all blame from <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is ſaid in <hi>Geneſis</hi> to have <hi>adored</hi> or worſhiped the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe <hi>'tis obſervable,</hi> ſays the Saint, <hi>that in the ſaid Commandment 'tis not ſaid, thou ſhalt</hi> worſhip <hi>God alone, as 'tis ſaid, and him alone thou ſhalt</hi> ſerve, <hi>which in</hi> Greek <hi>is <gap reason="foreign">

               <head>Principles of Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> which make void all Faith.</head>
               <p>The Catholics prove that an uncertain or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Faith is no Divino Faith, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants can never have of any one Article of their Religion, becauſe they never can have a certain One. 'Tis eaſily proved, becauſe they cannot have an Act of <hi>Faith</hi> of any <hi>One</hi> Article, till their <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> propoſes it, <hi>i. e.</hi> till they know <hi>certainly</hi> what Scripture teaches of it, not by any one Text, but by comparing all the Texts that ſpeak of that Subject: For the ſenſe of a ſingle Text (for Example, <hi>My Father is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than I,</hi> cannot be had, but by expounding it by other Texts on the ſame Subject: Till a Proteſtant then hath a <hi>certain Knowledge,</hi> firſt, That he hath <hi>all</hi> the Books of Holy Writ; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly. That all thoſe he owns for ſuch, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally written by inſpir'd Pens; thirdly, and (ſince <hi>the Letter kills</hi>) That he underſtands the <hi>true Senſe</hi> of each Text which relates to the Object of that Act of Faith; fourthly. That he remembers them all, ſo as comparing them, to ſee which is the <hi>clearer</hi> that muſt expound the <hi>obſcurer,</hi> and what is the <hi>reſult</hi> of them all, (for any <hi>one</hi> he underſtands not, or hath forgotten, may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44980:4"/> be that One that muſt expound the reſt) he cannot have <hi>One</hi> Act of Faith. Now Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics ſay this is impoſſible to any, or almoſt any man at leaſt, therefore very <hi>few Proteſtants</hi> (if any at all) can in their whole life have <hi>one Act of Divine Faith</hi> concerning any one Myſtery, tho' their Rule of Faith be never ſo good. Now what ſays Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> to give <hi>Proteſtants</hi> any <hi>Certainty?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fol. 78. <hi>Suppoſe the Proteſtant Faith uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, how is the Cauſe of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>the better?—Is</hi> Thomas <hi>an honeſt Man, becauſe</hi> John <hi>is a Knave?</hi> If <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>John</hi> be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeverally of a <hi>Theft,</hi> and the <hi>ſtolen Goods</hi> be found with <hi>John,</hi> I conceive tho' this prove not <hi>Thomas</hi> ſo aſſuredly an honeſt man, yet an <hi>honeſt Jury</hi> would I conceive bring him in <hi>Not Guilty.</hi> That there is a <hi>true Faith,</hi> and conſequently a <hi>certain Rule</hi> of Faith, all Chriſtians acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: <hi>Proteſtants</hi> on one ſide chooſe <hi>one Rule,</hi> (how differently ever they apply it) <hi>Catholics another.</hi> I conceive then that if the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Rule be proved <hi>uncertain,</hi> 'tis plain the Catholics Rule muſt be the <hi>certain One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fol. 80. <hi>This may ſignifie two things,</hi> firſt, <hi>That the Objects of our Faith are uncertain, and cannot be prov'd by certain Reaſons;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>That our Perſuaſion is wavering.</hi> One of the three <hi>modi ſciendi,</hi> or <hi>ways</hi> to come to the Knowledge of any thing, Known to every Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, is <hi>Diviſion,</hi> But our Doctor it ſeems is not ſo far advanced; for beſides the <hi>Two</hi> mentioned, it ſignifies a <hi>Third</hi> thing alſo; to wit, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reaſons there may be for a thing, he who believes it, hath for the motive of his Belief thoſe <hi>certain Reaſons.</hi> There are, for Example, <hi>certain Reaſons</hi> whereon to ground a Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> yet he that believes in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>his Mother hath taught him ſo,</hi> hath a very <hi>uncertain,</hi> and <hi>no Divine</hi> Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We believe the Apoſtles Creed, and whatever is contained in the Writings of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles. This is all we believe, and I hope they will not ſay theſe things are uncertain.</hi> They are in themſelves very certain, but not to any <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> whoſe <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> cannot make him <hi>certain</hi> of any one Article. But the pleaſant Anſwer! which juſtifies <hi>Turk, Jew,</hi> and <hi>Gentile.</hi> For this is the Rule of Faith, according to Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> moſt ſufficient: <hi>We believe all that God hath revealed, and nothing elſe: Is not all that He hath revealed certain?</hi> Here lies the Doctor's groſs miſtake, that no one is an <hi>Heretic</hi> for not believing <hi>what</hi> God has revealed to be true; 'tis impoſſible to come to ſo mad an Hereſie: But <hi>They</hi> are ſo for not believing him to have revealed what in effect he hath, and hath given ſufficient methods to come to the knowledge of, if they would but uſe them.</p>
               <p>Fol. 81. <hi>If theſe things be not built upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reaſons, their Infallible Church can have no certainty of the Chriſtian Faith.</hi> Even this is moſt notoriouſly falſe; ſince ſhe is not Infallible by any Light of her own, but by the Guidance of the Spirit of Truth. Were not the Apoſtles certain of what Chriſt told them, when they had acknowledg'd him the Son of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gave them certain reaſon for it? 'Tis a blind Impiety even to think ſo.</p>
               <p>Fol. 82. <hi>'Tis their common Argument, That there is a great variety amongſt Proteſtants, and that they condemn one another with equal confidence and aſſurance.</hi> 'Tis one of your uſual Artifices to leave out always the preſſing part of our Arguments. You ſhould have added, <hi>tho' they uſe the ſame Rule of Faith, and apply it by the ſame means.</hi> Thus propos'd, 'tis an unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable Argument againſt your <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> and evidently proves it <hi>uncertain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fol 83. <hi>Were all Proteſtants of a mind, would their conſent and agreement prove the certainty of the Proteſtant Faith?</hi> Not at all. Yet 'tis a moſt ridiculous Inference of yours (<hi>fol. 84.) This is the ſame Rule, and their diſagreement proves not their uncertainty.</hi> All <hi>Union</hi> is no Argument of the Spirit of God, for people may combine to do ill; yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, <hi>Diſunion</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention</hi> is a <hi>certain Mark</hi> of the abſence of the Spirit of God.</p>

               <p>It is, when a man's exterior Actions are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally capable of a good and pious meaning, and he ever and clearly declares that it is <hi>his,</hi> yet to faſten upon him another oppoſite deſign and meaning, taken from his <hi>Oppoſers</hi> contrary Principles; than which there cannot be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or more unjuſt <hi>diſingenuity.</hi> This he calls <hi>to joyn Proteſtant Principles with Popiſh Practices.</hi> Then he gives ſeveral inſtances that he is as good at the <hi>Practice</hi> as at the <hi>Theory</hi> of this his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim.
